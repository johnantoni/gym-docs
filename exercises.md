#### cardio

Stick with the bike (keeping your spine in a neutral position), or use the elliptical without the arms. For either piece of equipment, use the "sports intervals" setting, going as hard as you can without hip rotation on the higher settings, and going at a moderate/recovery pace on the lower settings. At the end of 15-20 minutes, you should be sweating buckets and feeling pretty tired. If not, go harder on the high intervals.

4 supersets sets of:

* high fives 15sec
* leg raises 15sec

with 20 sec rest 

repeated with planks/resisted sit ups

10 minuts with skipping rope
